# Arduino + Python

This project takes the temperature and pressure values ​​of the LM 35 and BMP 280 sensors and traces them in real time. For this, the sensors send data to arduino and this transmits them through UART to Python, to graph them.

The graphic in real time use Matlplotilib and was based on the example of www.toptechboy.com
